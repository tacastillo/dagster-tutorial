# Getting Started with GitHub Codespaces

## What is GitHub Codespaces?

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-hosted IDE. It's a fully-featured version of Visual Studio Code connected to GitHub.

Saving your code will be stored across Codespace sessions. You'll also be able to commit and raise pull requests from within the IDE.

## Opening a Codespace

Once it's open, give it a minute to start up and run `dagster dev` for you.

## Pricing and turning off your Codespace

The 2-Core version of GitHub Codespaces are free for up to 60 hours a month.

By default, GitHub codespaces will turn off on their own after 30 minutes of inactivity. You can also turn off your codespace manually in the IDE or from [the Codespaces page](www.github.com/codespaces).
